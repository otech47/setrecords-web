		<h1 id="dcmaHeader">StrEDM LLC’s Copyright and Digital Millenium Copyright Act Compliance Policy</h1> 
		<p>StrEDM LLC (dba “Setmine”) values and respects the rights of artists.  We endeavor to comply with copyright laws, including the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA), and avoid the infringement of copyrights or other intellectual property rights through the operation of our services.  This page describes certain aspects of our services, and some of the procedures we have implemented to promote compliance with copyright laws.
		</p>

		<h2 className="dcmaHeadline">Our Services and Licenses</h2>
		<p>StrEDM LLC provides services enabling the streaming of recordings of live performances.  Streamed content is procured with authorization from publicly accessible external servers or uploaded to our systems directly by parties believed to be authorized to provide content on our service.
		</p>

		<p>Additionally, StrEDM LLC has obtained, and is operating under, interactive streaming licenses from the performing arts organizations ASCAP, BMI and SESAC.</p>  

		<h2 className="dcmaHeadline">Remedy</h2> 
		<p>If any material provided by our services infringes on the copyright of any offended party, or if we reasonably come to believe that such material infringes, we may remove the content from our services (including the www.setmine.com web site and Setmine mobile apps)&nbsp;to prevent access to it, terminate or block access for those responsible for the content, and/or take any other action we deem appropriate. We may also pass along documentation relating to any infringement or allegation of infringement for documentation and/or publication by third parties at our discretion.
		</p>

		<h2> className="dcmaHeadline">DMCA Compliance</h2>
		<p>The DMCA, as codified in 17 U.S.C. 512, limits Internet Service Provider liability for copyright infringement, solely for transmitting information across the Internet, provided that certain procedures are in place to remove or limit access to infringing material.  We have implemented the procedures described below in an effort to rapidly and appropriately respond to any concerns about copyright infringement resulting from the operation of our service.  We request that you utilize the below procedures to most efficiently and effectively address any concerns.
		</p>

		<h2>className="dcmaHeadline">Notification</h2>
		<p>StrEDM LLC has assigned a Designated Agent to receive notification of claimed copyright or intellectual property infringement.  For your convenience and to speed resolution, notice of alleged infringement may be tendered to StrEDM via email to contact@setmine.com.  Please note that you may be liable for statutory and common law damages, as well as court costs and attorney fees, if you falsely claim that your copyrights have been violated.&nbsp;Significant damages have been awarded for illegitimate complaints.  Should you have any questions regarding the basis for your complaint, we encourage you to seek the help of competent counsel.
		</p>

		A proper notification MUST have at least the following information:,
		<ol>
			<li> 	Identify yourself as either: (a) the owner of a copyrighted work(s), or (b) a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
			<li>	State your contact information, including your legal name, street address, telephone number, and email address.</li>
			<li> 	Identify in detail the copyrighted work that you believe is being infringed. </li>
			<li> 	Specifically identify the material that you claim is infringing your copyrighted work, to which you are requesting that SetMine disable access across all of its platforms.  Please note that content streamed by our services typically involves lengthy performances.  If your copyright claim pertains to only a portion of a performance, please specify the name or URL of the performance, as well as the portion of the recording at issue. </li>
			<li> 	Include the following statement: “I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above as allegedly infringing is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.”</li>
			<li> 	Include the following statement: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.”</li>
			<li> 	Digitally sign your affirmation.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2 className="dcmaHeadline">Once Proper Infringement Notification is Received by the Designated Agent</h2>
		It is StrEDM’s policy: 
		  <ul className="dcma-indent">
		    <ul>to remove or disable access to the infringing material;</ul>
			<ul>to notify the content provider, member or user that it has removed or disabled access to the material; and</ul>
			<ul>that repeat offenders will have the infringing material removed from the system and that Company will terminate such content provider’s, member’s or user’s access to the Services.</ul>
		</ul>

		  <h2 className="dcmaHeadline">Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent</h2>
		  <p>If the content provider or user believes that the material that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or the content provider or user believes that it has the right to post and use the disputed material from the copyright owner, then the copyright owner’s agent, the content provider, or user (“the Countering Party”) must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent:
		  </p> 

		   <ul className="dcma-indent">
			    <li>A physical or electronic signature of the Countering Party;</li>
				<li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li>
				<li>A statement that the Countering Party has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material; and</li>
				<li>The Countering Party’s name, address, telephone number, and, if available, email address, and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the Countering Party’s address is located, or, if the Countering Party is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Company is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</li>
		   </ul>

		<p>If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Company may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Company may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Company’s discretion.<br/>
